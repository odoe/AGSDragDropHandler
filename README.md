# Drag and Drop Edit Demo

This is a sample demo showing how to use the browser drag n' drop
functionality to add new point data to your maps
in your [ArcGIS JavaScript] applications.

This has been tested to work in Chrome, IE, and Firefox.
This tool could be used to add new points to FeatureLayers as well.

Here is a [demo] of this application in action.
